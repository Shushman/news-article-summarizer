Before the official introduction of Apple's smartwatch last month, fans had seemingly decided on the company's behalf that the new product should be called the iWatch.
So when Tim Cook took the stage and sort of broke from gadget naming conventions, it came as a bit of a surprise to many Apple watchers.
His small Dublin-based software development studio owns the trademark for iWatch in the European Union, and he's warned Apple and other companies not to use the term.
For example, police in Vercelli, a small town in northern Italy, use it on their smartphones to send mugshots to headquarters.
Apple sued Amazon.com for using Appstore as the name for its Kindle software marketplace, kicking off two years of court battles that were eventually dismissed.
