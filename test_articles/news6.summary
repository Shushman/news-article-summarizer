Phone directory application Truecaller on wednesday launched a new app, Truedialer, which will offer users details of a person before the outgoing call is connected.
The app will be available for download on Google Play store.
Truedialer gives instant access to relevant information about contacts that users are trying to dial, it said in a statement.
If users are dialing a number for an individual or business outside of their phonebook, they will be able to see the name and a profile photo of whom they are about to dial before they place the call.
The integration of the Truecaller technology works in conjunction with Truedialer, it said.
However, the company currently has no plans of integrating the apps to offer a unified experience to users.
