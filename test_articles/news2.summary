Di Salvo, a 50-year-old Italian entrepreneur, co-founded Probendi in 2007. His small company developed an application called iWatch that helps different devices communicate with one another.
Probendi filed a trademark for iWatch, covering computing devices and software that went into effect on Aug. 3, 2008, Di Salvo says in a phone interview.
His small Dublin-based software development studio owns the trademark for iWatch in the European Union, and he's warned Apple and other companies not to use the term.
While the patent wars have ensnared tech giants including Apple in lengthy court battles, navigating the global trademark system can be just as taxing.

With a claim to the iWatch name, Probendi aims to take full advantage.
The company plans to build its own wearable device called the iWatch.
Di Salvo is traveling throughout China, searching for a manufacturer to churn out a gadget that undercuts the Apple Watchâ€™s $349 price tag.
