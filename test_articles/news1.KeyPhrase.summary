Some analysts like Mark Mahaney, Managing Director at RBC Capital Markets, contend its too late for Amazon to salvage the Fire phone, but Limp claims Amazon isnt yanking support any time soon.
In an interview with Fortune, Amazon Senior Vice President of Devices David Limp acknowledged Amazon bumbled the phones pricing.
In September, the company slashed the Fire phones price from $199 to 99 cents, a steep discount Limp said yielded significantly better sales.
With the Fire phone, Amazon plans to stay the course, as it has with its Kindle readers.
Likewise, Amazon seems intent on taking the same long-term approach with the Fire phone, despite a competitive smartphone market.
