WARSAW Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary said on Friday that his government would abandon, at least for now, a proposed tax on Internet usage that drew tens of thousands of demonstrators to the streets this week.
The same year, the government pulled back from a proposal to cut subsidies for university students that had ignited student protests.
Government press officers had said that the organizers of the protests which began in Budapest on Sunday and swelled much larger in the capital and in other cities on Tuesday had deliberately misrepresented the proposal as a new tax when it was actually just an extension of an existing telecommunications tax.
Mr. Orban said that instead of pushing ahead with the proposed tax, the government would begin discussions early next year about a broad variety of Internet issues, including regulation and taxation.
This was not the first time that the government of Mr. Orban, who has been accused of authoritarian impulses by domestic opponents and some Western leaders, has reacted to incipient protest movements.
