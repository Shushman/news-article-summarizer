WARSAW — Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary said on Friday that his government would abandon, at least for now, a proposed tax on Internet usage that drew tens of thousands of demonstrators to the streets this week.
Thousands of demonstrators held mobile phones as they crossed the Danube on Tuesday in Budapest to protest a proposed tax on Internet use.

Government press officers had said that the organizers of the protests — which began in Budapest on Sunday and swelled much larger in the capital and in other cities on Tuesday — had deliberately misrepresented the proposal as a new tax when it was actually just an extension of an existing telecommunications tax.
Under the proposal, Internet data was to be taxed at 150 Hungarian forints, or about 61 cents, per gigabyte. After the first protests on Sunday, the government inched back, saying it would cap the tax at 700 forints per month, but that failed to appease the protesters.
As the protests grew though, the proposal also drew criticism from right-wing quarters.
Julia Lakatos of the Center for Fair Political Analysis, an independent research group in Budapest, said she thought Mr. Orban had proposed the tax, in part, to draw attention from a recent rift with the United States.
Protest organizers said they would continue to keep an eye on the Internet tax proposal and vowed to keep their movement alive, but others were skeptical about their ability to do so.
