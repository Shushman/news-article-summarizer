With the Fire phone, Amazon plans to stay the course, as it has with its Kindle readers.
And a visit to the Fire phones page on Amazon.com reveals a 2-star customer rating; reviews call out issues like the Fire phone running hot and a small selection of apps.
We are going to keep iterating software features to get it better and better, said Limp.
Limp pointed out other Amazon devices, like its Fire tablet line and Fire TV streaming box, that he described as being very successful with customers, but he declined to discuss sales numbers.
But with the Fire phone, Amazon stuck to standard industry pricing, asking $199 for the 32 gigabyte model and $299 for the 64 gigabyte.
