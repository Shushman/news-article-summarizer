Before the official introduction of Apple's smartwatch last month, fans had seemingly decided on the company's behalf that the new product should be called the iWatch.
Probendi filed a trademark for iWatch, covering computing devices and software that went into effect on Aug. 3, 2008, Di Salvo says in a phone interview.
His small Dublin-based software development studio owns the trademark for iWatch in the European Union, and he's warned Apple and other companies not to use the term.
When the gadget finally hit the market, its name had changed to Apple TV following objections from British television network iTV.
Apple sued Amazon.com for using Appstore as the name for its Kindle software marketplace, kicking off two years of court battles that were eventually dismissed.
