Mr. Orban said that instead of pushing ahead with the proposed tax, the government would begin discussions early next year about a broad variety of Internet issues, including regulation and taxation.
However, it came at a much higher political cost than was expected as this was the largest protest so far against the current government.
Even Heti Valasz, a conservative periodical that normally supports the government, attacked the proposal.
27, 2014 After long years, Viktor Orban has recognized that he doesnt represent the point of view of the majority on an issue, and has admitted that the majority of the people rejected this tax, said Balazs Gulyas, 27, a former member of the Hungarian Socialist Party who set up a Facebook page last week that inspired the protests.
I am afraid this will put an end to the gatherings, Mr. Bodoky said.
