Around 100 people were buried alive in a tea-growing region of Sri Lanka on Wednesday as mudslides triggered by monsoon rains washed away their homes on a plantation, disaster officials said.
One witness spoke of hearing a noise like thunder as part of a mountainside collapsed onto the estate, burying some of the workers' homes in 30 feet (nine metres) of mud and debris.
Hundreds of soldiers, who initially used their hands to dig for survivors, had switched to operating excavators by evening but hopes had faded of finding anyone else still alive.
The minister said the search and rescue mission led by troops had now turned into a recovery operation, which they hope to resume at first light on Thursday.
He said using heavy machinery also had to be done carefully because the surrounding hills were unstable.
The region's top military official, Major General Mano Perera, said 302 people, including 75 schoolchildren, whose homes were destroyed in the mudslide were being looked after at two schools in the same area.
The mudslide hit at a time when most people were at work and children were already in school, leaving the elderly and the very young at home.
Kumara said 16 bodies have so far been recovered from the disaster around 200 kilometres (125 miles) east of the capital Colombo.
Military sources said they expected more heavy machinery to reach the site, but damage to roads as well as heavy rain and mist were slowing them down.
