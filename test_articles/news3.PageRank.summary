Government press officers had said that the organizers of the protests which began in Budapest on Sunday and swelled much larger in the capital and in other cities on Tuesday had deliberately misrepresented the proposal as a new tax when it was actually just an extension of an existing telecommunications tax.
WARSAW Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary said on Friday that his government would abandon, at least for now, a proposed tax on Internet usage that drew tens of thousands of demonstrators to the streets this week.
27, 2014 After long years, Viktor Orban has recognized that he doesnt represent the point of view of the majority on an issue, and has admitted that the majority of the people rejected this tax, said Balazs Gulyas, 27, a former member of the Hungarian Socialist Party who set up a Facebook page last week that inspired the protests.
Ebullient protest organizers who had charged that the proposed tax was an attempt by Mr. Orbans right-wing government to choke off one of the last sources of information not controlled by him and his allies called for victory celebrations across the country.
Julia Lakatos of the Center for Fair Political Analysis, an independent research group in Budapest, said she thought Mr. Orban had proposed the tax, in part, to draw attention from a recent rift with the United States.
