Rohit Sharma, set for a return to the Indian side after being named in the squad for the first three ODIs against Sri Lanka next month, is hoping to once again put behind him injury and performance woes as he bids for a spot for the Tests in Australia and the 2015 World Cup. 
The last year has been a roller coaster for Rohit, from finally making his Test debut - and scoring a century - to suffering drops in form in Tests and ODIs, to fracturing a finger in England and missing the Champions League Twenty20 and the recent ODIs against West Indies, to being diagnosed with a shoulder problem. On the sidelines after he sustained a finger injury during India's tour to England, the 27-year-old India batsman told ESPNcricinfo that the last 12 months had been somewhat disappointing but that he was determined to turn his latest comeback into a long-term run. 
"Mentally it's very frustrating. What can you do?" he said. "When you play well and get injured for the rest of the series and miss so many games, is quite frustrating. Personally, I won't say I am trapped, but I am very unfortunate that I have got injured at crucial period of my career. 
"I have missed out on a lot of games after getting injured. South Africa Test match in India [in 2010], I got injured on the morning of the match and then I had to wait for four years to make my Test debut. Again in England in 2011, my finger got injured in the first one-dayer and I missed nine one-days thereafter. Now also, it is almost nine ODIs now - three in England, three against West Indies and three against Sri Lanka now. It's very frustrating when you have a season like that and then you miss games due to injuries... You know it's very difficult to come back. But see I am strong enough. I understand my game. I understand me as a person now. I know how to deal with my game and I am keen to come back. Coming back to where I was is very important." 
After five ODIs against Sri Lanka, India travel to Australia to play four Tests followed by an ODI tri-series also featuring England, leading up to their defence of the World Cup starting late February. Determined to feature in the full tour, Rohit said he had nothing to prove to anyone. 
"I have to prove it to myself that I am much more capable than what I have done so far. I want to keep proving it to myself. When I look into the mirror and when I talk to myself, I should be able to look into my eyes and talk to myself about my achievements. The next five months, I have to be very focused and my thought process has to be very clear. Once I get into the season, I cannot have too many thoughts in my head so that it doesn't put me into a lot of trouble. I should be very clear in what I have to do. These two months which I got were very helpful to work on and become a good cricketer mentally. I have worked on a few things on the mental aspect and that will hopefully help me not just for the next five months but the next five years." 
Despite holding his place in ODIs since he returned to the side in January 2013, in Tests he has been far from convincing, despite scoring centuries in his first two matches. After taking 177 and 111* in consecutive innings off a lacklustre West Indies attack at home in November 2013, Rohit struggled in South Africa and New Zealand - he made 167 runs in four Tests - and was dropped from the XI during the tour of England. When he returned to the team for the third Test at Southampton, Rohit scored 28 and 6 with poor shot selection leading to his exclusion again. 
Asked about his inconsistency in Tests, Rohit was quick to rubbish the theory that his choice of shots was a factor. "It is not about the shots. Not at all," he said. "That's my natural game and I will back myself to play my natural game any day. With those shots even if you get out, I will never mind getting out like that because that's my shot. When I clear the fielder, it is a four or a six and everybody claps. That's not an issue. 
"As a cricketer I am disappointed," added Rohit. "But fortunes haven't gone my way also. I was to make my Test debut in 2010 but got injured and then had to wait till 2013. Injuries have kept me away and a few of disappointing series have also... I am the one to be blamed and no one else. But it's fine. I cannot get frustrated and think too much about my game too much. I understand that I haven't done justice to my potential and abilities. It's okay. I want to stay positive and keep looking forward to every challenge that lies ahead."
