Rohit Sharma, set for a return to the Indian side after being named in the squad for the first three ODIs against Sri Lanka next month, is hoping to once again put behind him injury and performance woes as he bids for a spot for the Tests in Australia and the 2015 World Cup.
The last year has been a roller coaster for Rohit, from finally making his Test debut - and scoring a century - to suffering drops in form in Tests and ODIs, to fracturing a finger in England and missing the Champions League Twenty20 and the recent ODIs against West Indies, to being diagnosed with a shoulder problem.
After five ODIs against Sri Lanka, India travel to Australia to play four Tests followed by an ODI tri-series also featuring England, leading up to their defence of the World Cup starting late February.
Despite holding his place in ODIs since he returned to the side in January 2013, in Tests he has been far from convincing, despite scoring centuries in his first two matches.
After taking 177 and 111* in consecutive innings off a lacklustre West Indies attack at home in November 2013, Rohit struggled in South Africa and New Zealand - he made 167 runs in four Tests - and was dropped from the XI during the tour of England.
Asked about his inconsistency in Tests, Rohit was quick to rubbish the theory that his choice of shots was a factor.
